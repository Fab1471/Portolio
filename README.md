# FabrÃ­cio Figueiredo's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This website is a showcase of my skills, projects, and a way to connect with me. Itâ€™s a reflection of my journey as a Backend Developer, and Iâ€™m proud to say that this entire project was created in a single stretch of inspiration and hard work on **02/01/2025** and the early hours of **03/01/2025**, right after arriving home from iFood at **6 PM**. Itâ€™s now past midnight, and Iâ€™m still here refining and polishingâ€”because that's how passion and dedication look like! ðŸ˜„

This portfolio is **still a work in progress**, but Iâ€™m constantly improving and updating it with new features, projects, and enhancements. Stay tuned as I continue to refine and add to it!
